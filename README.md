# flux

A Clojure based Solr client. Current version support is 4.6.0.

## Usage

###Http

```clojure
(require '[flux.http :as http])

(def conn (http/create "http://localhost:8983/solr" :collection1))
```

###Embedded

```clojure
(require '[flux.embedded :as embedded])

(def cc (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home" "path/to/solr.xml"))
```

####Core auto-discovery
Flux also supports core.properties. Just give `create-core` the solr-home path as the only argument and Flux will use the org.apache.solr.core.CoresLocator object for discovering cores:

```clojure
(def cc (embedded/create-core-container "path/to/solr-home"))
```

Now create the embedded server instance:

```clojure
(def conn (embedded/create core :collection1))
```

###Client
Once a connection as been created, use the with-connection macro to wrap client calls:

```clojure
(require '[flux.core :as flux])

(flux/with-connection conn
    (flux/add [{:id 1} {:id 2}])
    (flux/commit)
	(flux/query "*:*"))
```

###Test
```shell
lein midje
```
